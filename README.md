# Super Moving Platform (Custom Importer Example)

This Unity project demonstrates how a [SuperTiled2Unity](https://seanba.com/supertiled2unity.html) Custom Importer can help you add prefabs to your imported [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) files. See `TrackCustomImporter.cs` - it is the custom importer that does most of the work.
